# NORS - ADMIN PANEL
On top of the MVP implementation, we have reworked some backend logic and created the Admin panel. The Admin panel allows Admins to access and alter user accounts, job postings, and enter jobs directly. In accordance with the MVP and this assignment's description, the Admin panel is only accessible to users with the Administrator role, and it is checked upon login attempt. If a user is not logged in as an Admin, they will be forced to do so before proceeding. It must be noted that this logic is NOT implemented on the admin-users and admin-posts pages for grading accessbility. Once this app is moved towards a more final form, this will be implemented on those pages as well. Also, localStorage is editable in the browser. This vulnerability is also intentional for grading accessibility so that you may access and view the Admin homepage. In accordance with the assignment description, Admins may see the information of all registered users (currently only implemented with applicants) and may approve, delete, or reject job postings.
